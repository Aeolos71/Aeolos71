#### I'm Dimitris, a full stack developer currently studying at HyperionDev in DfE Web Development Bootcamp.
  
💻 Computers were always my passion. I remember myself when I was at school trying to find some time to escape to the only one computer room we had so I could stay in front of a blank screen and watching, as I couldn't do anything else (lack of knowledge 😢).

🇬🇷 I am originally from Greece but I live in 🇬🇧 UK for 18 years. I am British Citizen with full rights to live and work in UK as I am the owner of a British passport.

🥅 My goal is to be able to work in some high level company so that I can turn this passion into energy as it is impossible for me to see it as a mandatory job. So if this sounds interesting to you please do not hesitate to contact me.
